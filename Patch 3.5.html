<p> Here are the patch notes for Fortnite v3.5! </p>

<h2>General</h2>

<h2>Battle Royale</h2>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Two teams of 50 fight to the finish!

<ul>
	<li>Major optimizations + improvements made to console load times and CPU performance.
	<ul>
		<li><em>We&#39;ve made some data layout optimizations in order to improve load times and performance. Load times reduced by 25-30 seconds as a result of these changes on Xbox One and around 10 seconds on PS4. On both platforms, we expect to see fewer issues with geometry or cosmetics failing to load in time, and FPS drops during skydiving. The Xbox One download will be larger than normal in this release as a result of these optimizations. We&#39;re working to minimize the impact of this type of optimization in future releases. - Developer Comment</em></li>
