<ul>
	<li>Take down Thanos, equip the Gauntlet and claim Victory!</li>
	<li>Mashup Details
	<ul>
		<li>Early in the match, a meteor will land in the storm safe zone, delivering the Infinity Gauntlet.</li>
		<li>Any player who uses the Infinity Gauntlet will transform into Thanos.</li>
		<li>Stats are recorded for this LTM and can be found in the Solo tab.</li>
		<li>If Thanos is eliminated, the Gauntlet will fall to the ground, free for the taking. If it sits unused for too long, it will disappear until another meteor appears.</li>
		<li>Last player standing will be the victor!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Thanos Details
	<ul>
		<li><em>Ability 1</em> - A mighty punch that knocks enemies back and destroys structures.</li>
		<li><em>Ability 2</em> - Thanos flies towards the ground, hitting an area for knockback and damage.</li>

		<li><em>Ability 4</em> - A super-jump that can vault Thanos over all but the largest obstructions.</li>

		<li>Thanos doesn&#39;t take fall damage.</li>
		<li>Thanos does not build, use weapons or things like launch pads. He has no need for such petty human devices.</li>
