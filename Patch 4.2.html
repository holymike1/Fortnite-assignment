<ul>
	<li>Introducing the Perk Recombobulator (<em>For more info, check out our blog <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/item-perk-recombobulator">here</a></em>)!

	<ul>
		<li>To access the Perk Recombobulator, visit the item upgrade screen and navigate to the Upgrade > Modify Perks option.
		<ul>
			<li>This system is available after completing Plankerton Storm Shield Defense 2.</li>
			<li>Upon completion, players unlock a sequence of tutorial quests for the Perk Recombobulator along with enough resources to complete them.</li>
			<li>Players who have already completed Plankerton Storm Shield Defense 2 will already have the quests unlocked, including the initial resources.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Using the Perk Recombobulator, players can choose their schematic perks, as well as upgrade their strength.
		<ul>
			<li>You can select the perk you want in the slot from a list of perks that fit in that slot, with no random rolls required!</li>
			<li>With two new tiers of power for perks, schematics can ultimately become more powerful than ever before!</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Schematics earned before v4.2 (legacy schematics) are required to undergo a conversion process before their perks can be modified.</li>
		<li>The Perk Recombobulator uses brand new resources!
		<ul>
			<li>RE-PERK (used to both change and upgrade perks)</li>
			<li>PERK-UP (used to upgrade perks)</li>
			<li>FIRE-UP (used to switch element to fire)</li>
			<li>AMP-UP (used to switch element to nature)</li>
			<li>FROST-UP (used to switch element to water)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Perk resources will be in the Event Store (<em>available Wed., May 16 at 8pm ET</em>).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added the ability to upgrade Weapon and Trap Schematic Rarity.
	<ul>
		<li>Uses the same recipe as Hero Rarity Upgrade.</li>
		<li>Legacy schematics must be converted by the Perk Recombobulator before their rarity can be upgraded.</li>
		<li>Unlocked by the 2-Star Evolution Skill Tree Nodes for weapons and traps.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Updated Mission Rewards and Mini-Boss Mission Alerts to sometimes award RE-PERK and PERK-UP as secondary loot rewards, beginning in early Plankerton. As a result:
	<ul>
		<li>Crafting Materials (Ore, Gizmos, etc.) will appear significantly less often in later zones.</li>
		<li>XP and Evolution Materials (Drops of Rain, Lightning in a Bottle, etc.) will appear slightly less often.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Elemental Storm Mission Alerts are now available.
	<ul>
		<li>All elemental Husks in these zones will be locked to the zone’s element.</li>
		<li>Each zone awards Elemental Perk currencies for their respective elements: FIRE-UP, AMP-UP, and FROST-UP.
		<ul>
			<li>These currencies can be used in combination with RE-PERK to change the elemental perks on weapon schematics.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Quota: 2 each</li>

	</li>
	<li>Repeatable Quests are now available that award Perk currencies.

		<li>Open Caches quest awards RE-PERK currency.</li>
		<li>Kill Mist Monsters quest awards RE-PERK currency.</li>

		<ul>
			<li><em>NOTE:</em> Elemental Husks can be found in Plankerton or higher areas.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Kill a Chrome Husky quest awards RE-PERK currency.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Repair the Shelter raid
	<ul>
		<li>In order to reduce the length of the raid fights, they are no longer timed fights.</li>
		<li>Players are now required to eliminate a set number of enemies for each raid.
		<ul>
			<li>The final encounter is still time-based.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The number of enemies will increase by 10 enemies each of the first 3 raids and then remain at 3rd raid values.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Mini Llama rewards now scale for Storm Shield Defenses.
	<ul>
		<li>Before, players could earn a fixed amount of Mini Llamas (1-4) based on mission performance, as it didn’t take difficulty into account.</li>
		<li>The new reward breakdown for Mini Llamas is as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Stonewood: 1 to 4</li>
			<li>Plankerton: 2 to 5</li>
			<li>Canny Valley: 3 to 6</li>
			<li>Twine Peaks: 4 to 7</li>

	<li>Critical Rating:
	<ul>
		<li>Critical Rating is the new way we will be evaluating Critical Chance in game.</li>
		<li>All perks that would previously grant Critical Chance now grant Critical Rating.
		<ul>

			<li>Critical Rating is then converted into Critical Chance.</li>
			<li>This Critical Chance is then added to your weapon’s base Critical Chance value.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Critical Rating changes only affect newly-acquired Schematics, or Schematics that are converted using the Recombobulator.</li>
		<li>All Heros and Defenders have been changed to use Critical Rating.</li>
		<li>As a part of these changes base Critical Chance on all ranged weapons has been increased by 5%.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
