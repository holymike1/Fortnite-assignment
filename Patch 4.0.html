	<li>Added icons for the tabs at the top of the Settings screen.</li>
	<li>Added “Ignore Gamepad Input” option to the Accessibility settings tab.
	<ul>
		<li>This setting can be helpful to players who use external programs to remap their controller input and need the game to ignore the controller input.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Structures on the starting island can now be destroyed. Not the Battle Bus, though.</li>
	<li>Headshots are now prioritized when other body parts are in the way.
	<ul>
		<li>Incoming headshots (from above or straight on) will no longer be blocked by your character&#39;s other body parts.</li>

		<li>Headshots from below that are blocked by a body part (legs, torso, hands, shoulders, arms) will do normal damage, except for impacts very close to your character’s head.</li>
		<li>This change affects all weapons, except for the Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Slightly reduced the hitbox size of player hands.</li>
	<li>Damage numbers are now visible when spectating a player.</li>
	<li>Knocking a player off the island will award elimination credit like normal fall damage.</li>

	<li>On the starting island, you can now see other players (and player-created structures) about three times further away than before.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue that would cause player built structures to appear intact for a few seconds after eliminating an enemy and destroying the structure at the same time.
	<ul>
		<li>This caused players to “phase through” the structure.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed cases where pickups moved erratically when sliding down slopes.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where destroying a building from under an enemy wouldn’t award kill credit.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where swinging the pickaxe could cause movement stuttering.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where some pre-placed wooden archways could not be destroyed by player built structures.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that made the Battle Bus appear to quickly fly off the map after jumping from it.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that would pause a downed players health bar if their reviver disconnected while reviving them.</li>
</ul>
